# Hi, I'm Josh Pablico

Data Center Technician | Aspiring Network Engineer | Automation-Oriented Builder

I'm currently a Data Center Technician at **Cloud Key**, where I focus on hardware provisioning, infrastructure uptime, and building internal tools that improve workflow efficiency. I also study networking (CCNA in progress) and spend time developing web tools and browser extensions that support data center operations.
